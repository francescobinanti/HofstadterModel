## General Information
This project is related to my research activity as a PhD student in the LPMMC laboratory, CNRS (Grenoble).

It provides an exact diagonalization of the Hofstadter model for interacting bosons on a square lattice:
$$H = -J\sum_{m,n} \bigg ( b^\dagger_{m+1,n} b_{m,n}e^{i2\pi\alpha n} + b^\dagger_{m,n+1} b_{m,n} + \text{h.c.} \bigg ) + \frac{U}{2}\sum_{m,n} b^\dagger_{m,n} b_{m,n} \left( b^\dagger_{m,n} b_{m,n} - 1 \right) + \sum_{m,n} V(m,n) b^\dagger_{m,n} b_{m,n}$$
It also gives a practical way to perform edge state spectroscopy via light-matter interaction, by mean of a
Laguerre-Gauss beam (periodic perturbation of the Hamiltonian above). The spatial modes of the LG laser are:
$$f_{n,l}(r,\theta) = L_n^l(r)\big( \frac{r}{r_0} \big)^l e^{\frac{r^2}{2r_0^2}} e^{i\theta l}$$
This gives a way to study the rich topological features of this model, that has already
been implemented in experiments and can be useful for future applications in quantum computing.

## Features
- Exact diagonalization of the Hofstadter Model with open boundary conditions
- Energy spectrum resolved in the C4 rotation symmetry
- Absorption spectra calculated via transition matrix elements (from the ground state) $\bra{\psi_n}f_{n,l}\ket{\psi_0}$
- Local particle density of a generic eigenstate of the Hamiltonian: $\bra{\psi_n}\hat n_i\ket{\psi_n}$

## Room for Improvement
Here some inspiration for improvement/features that might be done in the future, and an imminent to-do list.

Room for improvement/new features:
- Optimization for the building of the C4 symmetric Hamiltonian
- Add periodic boundary conditions (cylinder and torus geometries)

To be added soon:
- Time-dependent protocol to drive the system in the ground state with the LG perturbation and perform edge state spectroscopy

## Publications
[F. Binanti, N. Goldman, C. Repellin, ArXiv:2306.01624](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01624)
In this paper I used the code to benchmark an experimental protocol to detect topological edge states.
